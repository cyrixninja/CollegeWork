# My Programming Assignments

This repository contains my programming assignments for my computer science course.

## Structure

The repository is divided into semesters and subjects. For example, the `1st Sem` directory contains assignments from the first semester, and the `3rd Sem/DS` directory contains assignments related to Data Structures from the third semester.

## Building and Running Assignments

The assignments are written in C and can be built and run using any C compiler. For example, if you're using the GCC compiler, you can use the following commands:

```sh
gcc -o output_file input_file.c
./output_file
